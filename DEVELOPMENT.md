#### WEEK 1
- [x] Set up repository 
- [x] Write the Makefile
- [x] Get Dataset 
- [x] Add Contracts and Project Goals

#### We initiated all the fundamental files, such as Makefule, graph.cpp/h, edge.cpp/h, and our datasets. We got inspiration for these from past labs and mps! We also got the files for our chosen dataset and submitted supplementary files like contracts and potential goals.
---
#### WEEK 2
- [x] Implement Random Library 
- [x] Finish Initializing Graphs

#### We finished initializing the graph, so implementing the graph.cpp/h and edge.cpp/h onto our lastfm dataset. We also divided BFS and Dijkstra among the four of us into two teams. For Dijkstra, we implemented a class that will use graph.h and edge.h to go through a csv file and created functions like find_shortest_path.

#### WEEK 3
- [x] Implement code for BFS for normal graphs
- [x] Implement code for Dijkstra
- [x] Add basic tests for Dijkstra
- [x] Add basic tests for BFS

#### After completing the complete implimentation of Dijkstra algorithm, we created a baby csv file that copies an example from a video. We will use this as our exemplar and once we pass all necessary cases on the baby, we will start writing tests for the actual dataset.

#### As for BFS, we implemented the basic algorithm. 
#### In line with the feeback we got from various posts on Piazza and the Discord server, ee then made a smaller representation of our dataset to test our BFS implimentation and to check our progress.

#### WEEK 4
- [x] Updated BFS to include Components
- [ ] Implemented code to -----
- [x] Add additional tests of different types of graphs for BFS
- [ ] Add tests for -----

#### For Dijkstra..........
#### After our midpoint check-in with Brad, we updated our BFS implimentation to make it more extendible i.e. so that it can work for Components as well. We then added tests for our BFS implimentation to make sure it is air-tight.
