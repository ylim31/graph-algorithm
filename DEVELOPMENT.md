#### WEEK 1
- [x] Set up repository 
- [x] Write the Makefile
- [x] Get Dataset 
- [x] Add Contracts and Project Goals
We initiated all the fundamental filesm, such as Makefule, graph.cpp/h, edge.cpp/h, and our datasets. We also submitted supplementary files like contracts and goals.

#### WEEK 2
- [x] Implement Random Library 
- [x] Finish Initializing Graphs
- [ ] Added Comments 
We finished implementing initializing the graph, so implementing the graph.cpp/h and edge.cpp/h onto our lastfm dataset. We also divided BFS and Dijkstra among the four of us into two teams. For Dijkstra, we implemented a class that will use graph.h and edge.h to go through a csv file and created functions like find_shortest_path. As for BFS...

#### WEEK 3
- [ ] Implemented code for BFS 
- [x] Implemented code for Dijkstra
- [x] Add tests for Dijkstra
- [ ] Add tests for BFS
For Dijkstra, we created a baby csv file that copies an example from a video. We will use this as our exemplar and once we pass all necessary cases on the baby, we will start writing tests for the actual dataset.
