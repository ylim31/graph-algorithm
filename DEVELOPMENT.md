#### WEEK 1
- [x] Set up repository 
- [x] Write the Makefile
- [x] Get Dataset 
- [x] Add Contracts and Project Goals

#### We initiated all the fundamental files, such as Makefule, graph.cpp/h, edge.cpp/h, and our datasets. We got inspiration for these from past labs and mps! We also got the files for our chosen dataset and submitted supplementary files like contracts and potential goals.

#### WEEK 2
- [x] Implement Random Library 
- [x] Finish Initializing Graphs
- [ ] Added Comments 

#### We finished initializing the graph, so implementing the graph.cpp/h and edge.cpp/h onto our lastfm dataset. We also divided BFS and Dijkstra among the four of us into two teams. For Dijkstra, we implemented a class that will use graph.h and edge.h to go through a csv file and created functions like find_shortest_path. 

#### As for BFS...

#### WEEK 3
- [ ] Implemented code for BFS 
- [x] Implemented code for Dijkstra
- [x] Add tests for Dijkstra
- [ ] Add tests for BFS

#### After completing the complete implimentation of Dijkstra algorithm, we created a baby csv file that copies an example from a video. We will use this as our exemplar and once we pass all necessary cases on the baby, we will start writing tests for the actual dataset.
