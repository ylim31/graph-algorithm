Team Meetings

1. All members will be meeting at least twice per week, but will meet more if
necessary.
2. Each meeting should last less than thirty minutes, unless exceptions are made.
All members who confirmed their presence for the meeting should be present. If
there are time conflicts, the one who cannot make the meeting should make this
clear and make accommodations.
3. We will use Discord servers to carry out communications and meetings will be
held on Zoom.
4. There will be a member counting the minutes in each meeting in order to
document the important decisions made in the meetings. This note-taker will
alternate every meeting among the four members.
Deadlines
1. Each meeting will clarify what kind of tasks are due for each person and that
person is expected to finish said task by the decided deadline.
2. In cases where an assigned task is left incomplete due to special circumstances,
the other group members should aim to help finish the incomplete task.
3. All the work would be equally divided as decided by the team during the meeting.
Assistance
1. When in need of assistance, members can contact each other through the
discord channel.
2. Every message should be replied as soon as possible. Accounting for the
difference in timezone, the message should be responded within 10 hours at the
latest.
3. We have divided different tasks to different channels, so communication is
organized.
Respect
1. We will make sure we treat every meeting like any other discussion class or lab
class. So, this will include no interrupting, no destructive criticism, and etcetera.
2. No one would be judged on the work they do. We will have an open environment
where any member can reach out to his/her fellow teammates in case they canâ€™t
perform a task or have a query.
